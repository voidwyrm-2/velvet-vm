The list of instructions can be found in [instructions.md](<./instructions.md>)

The bytecode specification can be found in [bytecode.md](<./bytecode.md>)

Examples of the bytecode assembly can be found in [examples](<./examples>)

An example of what the bytecode itself looks like can be found in [bytecode-test.bc](<./examples/bytecode-test.bc>) and [bytecode-test.bin](<./examples/bytecode-test.bin>)
